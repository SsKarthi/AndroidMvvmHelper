The AndroidMvvmHelper library is a set of basic classes for convenient work with MVVM. We strongly recommend you to read our blog post about [how to make an MVVM architecture in Android](https://stfalcon.com/en/blog/post/android-mvvm)

### What is this library for?

This helper-library includes classes for working with Activity (`BindingActivity` and `ActivityViewModel`), and with Fragment (`BindingFragment` and `FragmentViewModel`), which already have binding logic, and the necessary methods for callbacks are also defined.
